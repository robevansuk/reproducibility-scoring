As a modern definitive filling material, a packable bulk fill composite is the perfect alternative to amalgam. Ecosite Bulk Fill, DMG's newly developed posterior tooth composite, makes it even easier for dentists to perform quality fillings quickly.

The material is applied in one step, with no time-consuming layering required. Curing performed reliably up to 5 mm in only 20 seconds.The extremely low shrinkage stress values of Ecosite Bulk Fill minimise shrinking stress and ensure a durable and safe marginal finish. The packable nano-hybrid composite also has excellent thixotropic properties which allow for a controlled adaptation to the cavity walls.

The firmer material consistency ensures particularly convenient and precise handling. In practice this means easy shaping, precise contact point design and significant time savings in finishing.

The Starter Kit includes Ecosite Bond, a perfectly matched one-bottle universal bond, which allows practitioners free choice when conditioning. Ecosite Bulk Fill is also perfectly compatible with other light-curing bonds of your choice. In addition, the functional shade system with two aesthetically pleasing all-purpose shades supports incredibly intuitive and simple application.

Ecosite Bulk Fill makes standard care procedures significantly easier.
